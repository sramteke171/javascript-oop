# Object-Oriented Programming in Javascript

## Learning Objectives
- Answer the question, what is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Identify and define: a class, an instance, a constructor and inheritance
- Use the `new` keyword to create instances of a class
- Create a class that inherits from another using the `extends` and `super` keywords

## Overview
Today's day-long workshop on Object Oriented Programming and Object Oriented JavaScript will be broken up in to 3 sections followed by a mini-lab at the end of the day:

**Part 1:**

| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Object Oriented Programming](object-oriented-programming.md) | Define and discuss the key concepts of OOP as a  paradigm of software development. |
| [Object Oriented JavaScript](object-oriented-javascript.md) | Learn how to organize your code in an OOP style in JavaScript. |

 **Part 2:** 
 
| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [OOJS Practice](oojs-practice.md) | Practice designing and implementing OOP solutions in JavaScript. |
| [Gladiator](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/js-gladiator) | Mini-lab on using OOJS to implement a simple Gladiator game. |
